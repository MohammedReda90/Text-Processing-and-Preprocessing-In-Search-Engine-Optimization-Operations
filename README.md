# Text Processing and Preprocessing In Optimizing Search Engine Operations
## I had write a lot of algorithms that use in optimizing serach engine operation such as:
* Tokenization: Dividing text into smaller units, such as words or sentences.
* Stemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root forms.
* Stopword Removal: Removing common words (like “and”, “the”, “is”) that may not carry significant meaning.
* Text Normalization: Standardizing text, including case normalization, removing punctuation, and correcting spelling errors.
